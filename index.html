    <h2>About Me</h2>

<img src="images/picture-of-myself.JPG" alt="Selfie of Alex Hanlan" width="500">

        <p><strong>A quick intro about me:</strong> My name is Alex, short for Alexandra. I am a first-year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College. I have two pets: a cat (Tommy) and a dog (Hershey). And during my free time, I’ll often either be watching movies and tv shows as a way for me to wind down, or I might be playing games on my PlayStation.</p>

         <p>Before applying to the Graphic Design program, I was enrolled in the one-year Design Foundations program, also at Algonquin College. During that year, I learned so much, and by the time I graduated, I was confident in my choice to apply for the Graphic Design program.</p>
